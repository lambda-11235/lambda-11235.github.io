title: About
---

I'm an amateur programmer who enjoys functional programming. Most of my projects
outside of college involve programming language, especially the use of static
analysis and type theory to improve the correctness of programs. I'm also
interested in hardware an low-level systems, although I have so far been limited
to learning the theory.


The languages I have the most experience in are

1. Haskell
2. C/C++
3. Java
4. Python
5. Scala
6. Clojure
7. Scheme
8. Prolog

I also have some experience with

1. Assembly (x86-64, ARM, MIPS)
2. SML
3. Lua
4. Idris
5. Rust
