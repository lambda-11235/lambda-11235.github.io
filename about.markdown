title: About
---

I'm an alumnus from U.C. Davis with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
Engineering.
My main area of interest right now is network congestion control.
My previous interests include programming languages, type theory, and low-level
programming.
I'm also interested in applying machine learning and parallelism to
these areas.
I am currently pursueing a PhD in computer science at U.C. Davis.

In coding circles (i.e. GitHub and Freenode) I usually go by the nickname lambda-11235.
