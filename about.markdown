I'm a college senior planning to graduate in spring of 2019. I'm majoring in
CS and Engineering. My work so far has focused mainly on networking congestion
control, kernel development, and programming languages. I've also done some work
in machine learning and game programming (for 2D I've worked on the code, for 3D
I've only done asset design).

I'll be looking for a job as of summer 2019, so feel free to contact me.


The languages I have the most experience in are

1. C/C++
2. Python
3. Haskell
4. Scala
5. Java
6. Clojure
7. Scheme
8. Prolog

I also have some experience with

1. Assembly (x86-64, ARM, MIPS)
2. SML
3. Lua
4. Idris
5. Rust
