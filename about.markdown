title: About
---

I'm an alumnus from U.C. Davis with a Master's degree in Computer
Science.
My main interest is working with Linux systems.
My other interests include programming language theory, type theory,
and low-level programming.

In coding circles (i.e. GitHub and Freenode) I usually go by the nickname lambda-11235.
