<p>The following is a selection of poems I wrote for my English class. Hope you
enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="the-miller">The Miller</h3>
<div class="line-block">Look at that miller<br />
Down to the village<br />
Homes of the tillers<br />
To hand out his millage</div>
<h3 id="hopscotch">Hopscotch</h3>
<div class="line-block">Hopscotch today<br />
Watch the children play<br />
All for one, and one for all<br />
Until someone takes a great fall<br />
<br />
The teachers come out<br />
Taking the fastest route<br />
To stop the play<br />
No hopscotch today</div>
<h3 id="taut">Taut</h3>
<div class="line-block">A man with many crimes<br />
He listens to the chimes<br />
A man with little virtue<br />
About to meet his curfew<br />
<br />
The people look on<br />
Standing under the tree<br />
About to be free<br />
<br />
The lone leaf falls<br />
Yet no one bawls<br />
And the people are gone</div>
<h3 id="savannah">Savannah</h3>
<div class="line-block">Two more, Three more<br />
From the trees they tore<br />
From whence they came before<br />
<br />
The guns that wait<br />
In the grass so high<br />
Death ready to fly<br />
To stop their gait<br />
<br />
The sun hugs the earth<br />
And the guns go home<br />
Sharing in their mirth</div>
<h3 id="hear-the-wind">Hear the Wind</h3>
<div class="line-block">What is it we hear blowing on the wind?<br />
Coming from every corner and every bend<br />
<br />
It flows through the trees<br />
Like a hive of carefree bees<br />
<br />
Where it begins, no one knows<br />
Where it ends, go the crows<br />
<br />
A mysterious wind, making trees bend<br />
What is it we hear blowing on that wind?</div>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<div class="line-block">Have an assignment<br />
Give in to resignment<br />
<br />
Stopping for procrastenation<br />
Gives forth to agitation<br />
<br />
How to proceed?<br />
That answer I need<br />
<br />
What’s the holdup?<br />
Time’s almost all up</div>
