The following is a selection of poems I wrote for my English class. Hope you
enjoy.

### The Miller

| Look at that miller
| Down to the village
| Homes of the tillers
| To hand out his millage

### Hopscotch

| Hopscotch today
| Watch the children play
| All for one, and one for all
| Until someone takes a great fall
|
| The teachers come out
| Taking the fastest route
| To stop the play
| No hopscotch today

### Taut

| A man with many crimes
| He listens to the chimes
| A man with little virtue
| About to meet his curfew
|
| The people look on
| Standing under the tree
| About to be free
|
| The lone leaf falls
| Yet no one bawls
| And the people are gone

### Savannah

| Two more, Three more
| From the trees they tore
| From whence they came before
|
| The guns that wait
| In the grass so high
| Death ready to fly
| To stop their gait
|
| The sun hugs the earth
| And the guns go home
| Sharing in their mirth

### Hear the Wind

| What is it we hear blowing on the wind?
| Coming from every corner and every bend
|
| It flows through the trees
| Like a hive of carefree bees
|
| Where it begins, no one knows
| Where it ends, go the crows
|
| A mysterious wind, making trees bend
| What is it we hear blowing on that wind?

### Assignment

| Have an assignment
| Give in to resignment
|
| Stopping for procrastenation
| Gives forth to agitation
|
| How to proceed?
| That answer I need
|
| What's the holdup?
| Time's almost all up
