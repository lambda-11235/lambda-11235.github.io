This is a quick news update. I've recently started a new site where
people can find updates and information on my research project(s).
It can be found at
[https://lambda-11235.github.io/control_theo_network/](https://lambda-11235.github.io/control_theo_network/).
It contains code and a link to my papers, such as the recent
[arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09825).
